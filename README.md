# Table Of Hours

Table Of Hours is an over-engineered time management/to-do list/calendar/alarm clock app.

Currently in planning stages. This is the Python implementation of this service. The original is written in Golang.

### Branching and Environments

There will be a branch for each environment. Development will happen on master. Each environment is responsible for setting its own environment variables to use the correct configs.
